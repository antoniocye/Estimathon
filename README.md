# ESTIMATHON

## Quick Description
Estimathon is a game that involves estimating cool values to the greatest accuracy one is capable of reaching.
Those "values" can be serious, a bit goofy or very goofy. Some favorites are:
- Estimate the average number of barrels of oil used daily in 2023 in the United States.
- Estimate the number of distinct students who applied to all 8 ivy league colleges in 2022.
- Estimate the average "height of duck":"length of penis" ratio of an American duck.
- Estimate the average number that has been submitted for this question on this website.

Estimathon is very fun! It is a nerd game at its core  and has been played in dark nerd circles of the likes of Canada/USA Mathcamp and Jane Street Capital.
Now, a nerd has decided to make a website to make it easily playable!

## This codebase
I developped this website using ReactJS, HTML/CSS, and Firebase. The classes under the ```src/util``` communicate with the database in the backend (holding some kind of Model and Controller functionalities) and are called by the React components under ```src/pages``` and ```src/components``` (holding a View funcionality). One can definitely participate in adding cool functionalities if interested!
